# Step 15: Patterson's D/ABBA-BABA 

We would like to know where our kitchen flies come from! A common way to do this is by using Patterson's D/ABBA-BABA statistic, along with the f4-ratio, to look at gene flow between populations.

1. I downloaded the data from this paper[^1], head over *[here](https://dest.bio/)*, click on Data Files ->  SNP Tables -> scroll down to VCF files, then `Click to download a .txt file with a list of all download links`, open the link and in the terminal grab the vcf files (version 2) and their index: 

```
wget http://berglandlab.uvadcos.io/vcf/dest.PoolSeq.PoolSNP.001.50.10Nov2020.ann.vcf.gz
wget http://berglandlab.uvadcos.io/vcf/dest.PoolSeq.PoolSNP.001.50.10Nov2020.ann.vcf.gz.tbi
```

2. bcftools only recognizes bgzip files so make sure both your own data, and the DrosEU data is in this format AND you have an index.
   
```
bgzip -d SNPs_clean_ann_biallelic_filtered.vcf.gz
bgzip SNPs_clean_ann_biallelic_filtered.vcf
tabix SNPs_clean_ann_biallelic_filtered.vcf.gz
```

3. Merging. Initially, this did not work. First, I got a few warning messages "trying to combine "ADP" "AD" and "FREQ" tag definitions of different lengths and types", so I found a way to remove these annotations (maybe this is shooting myself in the foot) because it threw me an error ("Incorrect number of FORMAT/AD values at 2R:18615523, cannot merge. The tag is defined as Number =A but found 2 values and 4 alleles" by doing `bcftools annotate -x FORMAT/AD,INFO/FORMAT,FREQ SNPs_clean_ann_biallelic_filtered.vcf.gz -o SNPs_clean_noAnn_biallelic_filtered.vcf.gz`. However, Shangzhe helped me check the DrosEU dataset and apparently when they have triploids (or more), they have multiple values of allelic depth for each. Therefore, I filtered their dataset the same way I did in 12_postfilter section for biallelic sites only, then creatd an index (tabix) and merged them: `bcftools merge dest_ann_biallelic.vcf.gz SNPs_clean_ann_biallelic_filtered.vcf.gz -o kitchAndDros.vcf.gz`

4. Going to start using **[Dsuite](https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite)**[^2]. Download it using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite.git
$ cd Dsuite
$ make
```

Then I need to create an input text file of the sample names and populations, so I got the list of names and wrote it to a text file: `bcftools query -l kitchAndDros.vcf.gz > sampleNames.txt`. The Dsuite text file format requires one individual per row and a tab between the sample name and the population (so for example AT-Mau for Austria, Mautenbach): I rewrote it and saved it as a new text file.

Ind1    Species1
Ind2    Species1
...     ...
IndN    Species_n

To execute, I used the experimental Dquartets instead of Dtrio (I could have created an outgroup of our kitchenflies, I guess...)

```
./Build/Dsuite Dquartets \
kitchAndDros.vcf.gz \
sampleNames.txt \
--out-prefix=kitchAndDros
```

| Command      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `-` | input vcf.gz file (compressed with gzip or bzip), only uses biallelic SNPs |
| `-` | input text file with samples/populations |
| `--out-prefix=XXX` | output prefix for all your resulting files |

77 sets (populations/species), going to calcualte D and f4-ratio values for 1353275 quartets, VCFf contains 4093821 variants, block size of 204690 variants for 20 Jackknife blocks. I could / should run this in a slurm script....
