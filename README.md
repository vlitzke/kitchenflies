# Kitchen flies

These two pipelines are a synthesis from multiple sources - hardly my own code/mostly not my own words. The first comes from the DNASeq pipeline (Kapun's DrosEU work) and its associated resources, albeit in *slightly* more detail and the RNASeq comes from a mixture of a workshop + internet resources. 

I would suggest if you want to use this as a tool/guideline, to check out the *Other* folder first to familiarize yourself with setting up/running basic commands on the cluster. Then proceeding to one of the pipelines. 

Have fun! :)
